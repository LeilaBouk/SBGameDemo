# SpringBot Game Demo

## About

Spring Bot is a browser mini game made to help improve your typing skills! Designed with a retro flair and all original pixel art. 

This game was originally part of a group project. Please find the original project here - https://github.com/MiSkowron/springbot-game 

The original Heroku version of this web game is no longer available so I have decided to host it here. Login and save scores features are not supported in this version.
